## CS112 - Causal Inference Assignment
CS112 is a statistical information based decision making course. This assignment examines the causal inference between UN interventions and peace keeping progress in some countries.
### Description
The paper analyzes the impact (treatment effect) of UN peacekeeping interventions on the countriesâ€™ lenient peacebuilding success 2 years (*pbs2l*) and 5 years (*pbs5l*) after the war, with *untype* as the treatment and any countries that received any type of interventions (*untype* different from *None* or 0) belong to treatment group and control group otherwise. This is an observational study with matching techniques to increase accuracy by decreasing the dissimilarities between the two study group. The results show that UN interventions did increase the peace building success in the given countries by 0.2% after 2 years and 0.26% after 5 years.
